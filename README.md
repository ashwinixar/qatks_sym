Quantum cryptanalytic attacks of symmetric ciphers

The C code implements Quantum algorithm of symmetric cryptanalysis quantum attacks.
<a href=https://quest.qtechtheory.org/>QuEST</a> library is used to simulate quantum environment.<br/><br/>

"SPN_heys_8bit_with_cryptanalysis.cpp" contains the C++ code of custom 8-bit SPN cipher along with its linear and differential cryptanalysis. 

"A1.c" contains the C code of Quantum Differential Distinguisher. "A1.exe" is the respective executable.
"A2.c" contains the C code of Fully-quantum Quantum Differential Last-Rounds attack. "A2.exe" is the respective executable.
"A3.c" contains the C code of Quantum Differential Subkey-Recovery attack. "A3.exe" is the respective executable.
"QLC.c" constains the C code of Quantum Linear Cryptanalysis attack. "QLC.exe" is the respective executable.
